The "MyCustomScriptsDllExample.asmdef" asset will help you make an assembly. 
The problem is that you have to assign the references 
by hand if you want to export your own assemblies. 
In this case, all you need is the "TValle.Modding.Tools" assembly. 
In other cases, you will need more references.

I don't think these scripts are compatible with https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlatformDependentCompilation.html

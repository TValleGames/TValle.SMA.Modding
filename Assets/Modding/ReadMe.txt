Keep your mods organized by putting each one in its own folder. 
Your artist name or organization is an important detail. That is, 
make a new folder with your artist name or organization name, and then inside this folder, 
make a new folder for each mod. This will keep everything in order and reduce 
the chance of duplicate ids when the game loads your mods and mods from other people.
